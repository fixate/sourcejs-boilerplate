# Source.js `docs/` Boilerplate

A starting point for your specs on new [Source.js](https://github.com/sourcejs/Source) projects.

## Purpose

These folders are a replacement for the initial specs generated by Source.js. This will give you a headstart in that you will quickly have available to you all your base elements such as headers, lists, grids etc. and can quickly get on with building specs for your custom blocks / objects.

## Usage

You should only replace the initialised docs with these docs once you are
comfortable with how Source.js works. The initialised docs contain a lot of
useful information on setup, capabilities, and features of the engine.

Initialise Source.js and start the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/sourcejs/Source.git
cd Source

npm install
grunt init
node app.js
```

Overwrite the contents of `public/` with the contents of this repo.

Pew pew pew!
