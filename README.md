# Source.js Boilerplate

A starting point for your specs in new projects using [Source.js](https://github.com/sourcejs/Source).

## Purpose

These folders are a replacement for the initial specs generated by Source.js. You will find specs for base elements, your grid, colours used, and other helpers which allow you to get on with building specs for custom blocks and objects.

## Usage

Replace the initialised `public/` files with these files once you are comfortable with how Source.js works. The initialised docs contain a lot of useful information on setup, capabilities, and features of the engine.

Initialise Source.js and start the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/sourcejs/Source.git
cd Source

npm install
grunt init

sudo node app.js
```

Overwrite the contents of `public/` with the contents of this repo, and start writing your own specs.

Pew pew pew!
