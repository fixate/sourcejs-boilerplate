# Source.js `docs/` Boilerplate

A starting point for your specs on new [Source.js](https://github.com/sourcejs/Source) projects.

## Purpose

These folders are a replacement for the initial specs generated by Source.js. This will give you a headstart in that you will quickly have available to you all your base elements such as headers, lists, grids etc. and can quickly get on with building specs for your custom blocks / objects.

## Usage

Replace the contents of `client/src/docs/` with the contents of this repo.

Run `grunt update`

Pew pew pew!
